      "description": "TheNarayanhiti Palace Museumwas home to the royal family until a revolution took over the monarchy in 2006. I’m not sure what I was expecting to see in the palace, but I found this museum to be extremely interesting. Unlike every other palace I’ve been to, this one is very modern. It was built in the 1960’s and looks a bit like an episode ofMad Meninside. With its wood-paneled walls, marble tile flooring, and the smell of mothballs wafting off of old tiger skins that adorn the floor, it’s unlike any place I’ve ever been. The throne room appears to have been designed by an admirer of Gaudi, the famous Spanish architect. Everything seems a tad out of place for a royal palace, making it all the more fun to walk through. One of the more interesting and sad things about this palace is that it was the site of the royal massacre. If you’re not familiar with Nepal’s history, it’s a fascinating story. Although there are many versions, it seems that the most popular is a very bizarre love story. Prince Dipendra was madly in love with a woman whom his mother didn’t approve of. One night during a monthly reunion dinner, he got extremely drunk and high and was asked to leave the party. He later came back with several machine guns and shot the entire royal family, killing ten members and wounding many others. He then turned the gun on himself. It’s said that this event led to the downfall of the monarchy.",

I chose to walk which took about 40 minutes from Thamel. The National Museum has three buildings which each have their own distinct exhibits. The first one has art which is categorized by wood carvings, stone carvings, metal work, and paintings. The second is focused on the rise and spread of Buddhism, and how it is practiced differently throughout the country. I really liked seeing the changes Buddhism took on throughout time. I’ve always been curious about how Buddha started being worshipped as a god when he himself never believed in gods. The final building was a bit random with some natural history and dolls depicting costumes worn in different parts of the world.",

Each one had a few sentences below describing the war or battle and what was gained or lost. There was also a large map showing how Nepal was formed by gaining land throughout the years. I still need to read a lot to understand all the history, but it was a nice overview. A large portion of the museum is dedicated to the kings and leaders of the military. Each important figure has a large photo with their story next to it. There was also a section about military clothing, weapons, and awards. These sections had less writing, and I would have liked to see more translated to English.

The fire burns slowly over 2 hours and you don’t see as much as people think. It’s actually a very moving and beautiful ceremony. In a few religions, it’s important to watch someone’s body be cremated in order to understand how short life is and how our body does not belong to us. If seeing bodies cremated isn’t on your to do list, it’s also a beautiful place to walk around. There are so many temples to see, plus there’s a hill perched above the river offering great views.
